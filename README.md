# ExoMol-Database-URL-s
This Python Script can be run to obtain all file URL's from the ExoMol database. 
This is convenient for scientists wishing to use the ExoMol Molecule Data (e.g. for calculating cross-sections), without having to spend a copious amount of time clicking through all the links to download the ~3000 files.
A simple if statement can be added to just obtain the files for a certain molecule, or, just the trans/states/pf/model 
files for all molecules.
