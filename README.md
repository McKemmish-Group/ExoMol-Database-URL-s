# ExoMol-Database-URL-s
This Python Script can be run to obtain all file URL's from the ExoMol database. 
This is convenient for scientists wishing to use the ExoMol Molecule Data for cross-correlation or other 
reasons, without having to spend a copious amount of time clicking through all the links to download the ~3000 files.
A simple if statement can be added to just obtain the files for a certain molecule, or, just the trans/states/pf/model 
files for all molecules.
